# Chami

Chami is an application to manage and switch between sets of environment variables. It functions similarly to the Environment Variables feature in Microsoft PowerToys, but Chami has been around for quite a bit longer and, as such, features a few additional features, such as:

* The application allows you to be notified if a specific application is still running on an old set of environment variables
* The user can create template environments to help when creating a new environment, instead of starting from scratch
* The application actively monitors if there's something off with the current environment.

## Announcement

Chami was developed to solve an issue I faced while working my previous job. Since I'm moving to a position in a new company, I will stop adding new features and fixing bugs.

I took steps to notify the PowerToys team of the existence of Chami, but it's not given that they'd be willing to integrate what I have developed for this application.

As a result, version 2.0 will be the final version of Chami.
